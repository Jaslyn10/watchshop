## About the Project

This is a **Django-based web application** created to showcase my skills in backend development, database modeling, and deployment of dynamic websites using the Django framework.

It simulates a **watch listing and shopping platform** where users can view watches, add them to a cart or wishlist, and also upload their own watches for sale.

‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE**: This project is deployed with `DEBUG = True` for demonstration purposes only. Do not use this as-is for production. See below for production tips.
        **: The website is hosted on **Render using the free plan**. 
        If the app has been inactive for a while, it might take 30‚Äì60 seconds to load initially as the server spins back up. Please be patient ‚Äî the site will load shortly!
